INTEGRITY PROTOCOL — SPECIFICATION v0.1
=======================================

STATUS: Public Draft v0.1
AUTHOR: Anonymous
FILE: integrity.txt
FORMAT: Plain text (UTF-8)
SCOPE: Universal, verifiable transparency layer for any website or project.

INTRODUCTION
------------
The integrity.txt protocol defines a minimal, universal and verifiable way for any project, website or entity to publish a public statement of integrity and transparency. The protocol has no owner, no central authority and no infrastructure. It is implemented by placing a single text file named integrity.txt at the root of a domain or repository.

The goal is to establish a standard of verifiable, truthful and minimal commitments that any project can adopt voluntarily. All statements must be objectively checkable by any independent person.

THE 7 CORE RULES
----------------

1. FILE LOCATION  
   integrity.txt MUST be placed at the root of a domain or repository.  
   Examples:  
   https://example.com/integrity.txt  
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/project/main/integrity.txt

2. FORMAT  
   The file MUST be UTF-8 plain text.  
   No HTML. No JSON. No metadata. No binary content.  
   One declaration per line.  
   Format:  
   key: value

3. VERIFIABILITY  
   Every declaration MUST be objectively verifiable by an independent observer.  
   No claims that cannot be checked.  
   No unverifiable marketing or subjective statements.

4. HASH OF THE FILE  
   integrity.txt MUST include its own SHA-256 hash, computed on the exact file content.  
   The line MUST be:  
   hash: <sha256_value>  
   Anyone MUST be able to recalculate the hash and obtain the same value.

5. TRUTHFULNESS  
   All statements MUST be correct at the time of publication.  
   If anything becomes false due to a change in the project, the file MUST be updated.

6. NO PERSONAL DATA  
   The file MUST NOT contain names, emails, IP addresses or any personal data.  
   The protocol is anonymous by design.

7. PUBLIC ACCESS  
   The file MUST be publicly accessible without cookies, JavaScript, login or redirection.  
   Anyone should be able to download it directly.

RECOMMENDED DECLARATIONS
------------------------
The following lines are optional but recommended:

integrity: true  
version: v0.1  
updated: <ISO 8601 date>  
source-code: <public repository URL>  
transparency: <brief description>  
verification: <instructions or link>  

These declarations must remain verifiable.

VERIFICATION GUIDE
------------------
Any person can verify an integrity.txt file using the steps below:

1. Download the file directly from the root domain.  
2. Compute its SHA-256 hash using any public tool.  
3. Compare the computed hash with the hash declared in the file.  
4. Check that all statements are observable and true.  
5. Check that the file is UTF-8, text-only and follows the format.

If all checks pass, the file is valid.

VERSIONING
----------
Projects SHOULD update the "version" and "updated" fields when modifying the file.  
Breaking changes SHOULD increment the major version (v1 → v2).

BADGE (OPTIONAL)
----------------
Projects MAY display a badge in their README or site:

[ integrity: verified ]

This badge has no special visual requirement.  
It simply indicates the presence of a valid integrity.txt file.

SECURITY NOTES
--------------
- No server is required.  
- No dependency.  
- No blockchain.  
- No cryptographic signature is mandatory.  
- The SHA-256 hash provides integrity across time.  
- Additional proofs (e.g., timestamps) MAY be used but are not part of the core protocol.

PHILOSOPHY
----------
The protocol is based on three principles:

1. SIMPLICITY — One file, one purpose, zero friction.  
2. TRUTH — Only verifiable statements.  
3. UNIVERSALITY — Works for any project, any language, any domain.

The file is a public contract of honesty that anyone can inspect and verify.
